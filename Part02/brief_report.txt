This short report for the Final Assessment of UCP addresses the imperfections of the modified langton's ant simulation.

Imperfections/Issues:

1) When ants are on a green, red or blue cell, the are printed behind the coloured cell.
The user cannot see the ant on the terminal when this occurs but the ant is still moving accordingly to the simulation rules.

2) When an ant crosses the boundaries of the grid, the program stops ant gives a segmentation fault.
